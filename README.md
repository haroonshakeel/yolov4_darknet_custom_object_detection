## How to train (to detect your custom objects)

(to train old Yolo v2 `yolov2-voc.cfg`, `yolov2-tiny-voc.cfg`, `yolo-voc.cfg`, `yolo-voc.2.0.cfg`, ... [click by the link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/tree/47c7af1cea5bbdedf1184963355e6418cb8b1b4f#how-to-train-pascal-voc-data))

Training Yolo v4 (and v3):

0. For training `cfg/yolov4-custom.cfg` download the pre-trained weights-file (162 MB): [yolov4.conv.137](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.conv.137) (Google drive mirror [yolov4.conv.137](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JKF-bdIklxOOVy-2Cr5qdvjgGpmGfcbp) )

1. Create file `yolo-obj.cfg` with the same content as in `yolov4-custom.cfg` (or copy `yolov4-custom.cfg` to `yolo-obj.cfg)` and:

* change line batch to [`batch=64`]
* change line subdivisions to [`subdivisions=16`]
* change line max_batches to (`classes*2000` but not less than number of training images, but not less than number of training images and not less than `6000`), f.e. [`max_batches=6000`] if you train for 3 classes
* change line steps to 80% and 90% of max_batches, f.e. [`steps=4800,5400`]
* set network size `width=416 height=416` or any value multiple of 32
* change line `classes=80` to your number of objects in each of 3 `[yolo]`-layers:
* change [`filters=255`] to filters=(classes + 5)x3 in the 3 `[convolutional]` before each `[yolo]` layer, keep in mind that it only has to be the last `[convolutional]` before each of the `[yolo]` layers.

So if `classes=1` then should be `filters=18`. If `classes=2` then write `filters=21`.
  
**(Do not write in the cfg-file: filters=(classes + 5)x3)**
  
(Generally `filters` depends on the `classes`, `coords` and number of `mask`s, i.e. filters=`(classes + coords + 1)*<number of mask>`, where `mask` is indices of anchors. If `mask` is absence, then filters=`(classes + coords + 1)*num`)

So for example, for 2 objects, your file `yolo-obj.cfg` should differ from `yolov4-custom.cfg` in such lines in each of **3** [yolo]-layers:

```ini
[convolutional]
filters=21

[region]
classes=2
```

2. Create file `obj.names` in the directory `build\darknet\x64\data\`, with objects names - each in new line

3. Create file `obj.data` in the directory `build\darknet\x64\data\`, containing (where **classes = number of objects**):

  ```ini
  classes = 2
  train  = data/train.txt
  valid  = data/test.txt
  names = data/obj.names
  backup = backup/
  ```

4. Put image-files (.jpg) of your objects in the directory `build\darknet\x64\data\obj\`

5. You should label each object on images from your dataset. Use this visual GUI-software for marking bounded boxes of objects and generating annotation files for Yolo v2 & v3: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark

It will create `.txt`-file for each `.jpg`-image-file - in the same directory and with the same name, but with `.txt`-extension, and put to file: object number and object coordinates on this image, for each object in new line: 

`<object-class> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>`

  Where: 
  * `<object-class>` - integer object number from `0` to `(classes-1)`
  * `<x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>` - float values **relative** to width and height of image, it can be equal from `(0.0 to 1.0]`
  * for example: `<x> = <absolute_x> / <image_width>` or `<height> = <absolute_height> / <image_height>`
  * atention: `<x_center> <y_center>` - are center of rectangle (are not top-left corner)

  For example for `img1.jpg` you will be created `img1.txt` containing:

  ```
  1 0.716797 0.395833 0.216406 0.147222
  0 0.687109 0.379167 0.255469 0.158333
  1 0.420312 0.395833 0.140625 0.166667
  ```

6. Create file `train.txt` in directory `build\darknet\x64\data\`, with filenames of your images, each filename in new line, with path relative to `darknet.exe`, for example containing:

  ```
  data/obj/img1.jpg
  data/obj/img2.jpg
  data/obj/img3.jpg
  ```

7. Download pre-trained weights for the convolutional layers and put to the directory `build\darknet\x64`
    * for `yolov4.cfg`, `yolov4-custom.cfg` (162 MB): [yolov4.conv.137](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.conv.137) (Google drive mirror [yolov4.conv.137](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1JKF-bdIklxOOVy-2Cr5qdvjgGpmGfcbp) )
    * for `yolov4-tiny.cfg`, `yolov4-tiny-3l.cfg`, `yolov4-tiny-custom.cfg` (19 MB): [yolov4-tiny.conv.29](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.conv.29)  
    * for `csresnext50-panet-spp.cfg` (133 MB): [csresnext50-panet-spp.conv.112](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16yMYCLQTY_oDlCIZPfn_sab6KD3zgzGq/view?usp=sharing)
    * for `yolov3.cfg, yolov3-spp.cfg` (154 MB): [darknet53.conv.74](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74)
    * for `yolov3-tiny-prn.cfg , yolov3-tiny.cfg` (6 MB): [yolov3-tiny.conv.11](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18v36esoXCh-PsOKwyP2GWrpYDptDY8Zf/view?usp=sharing)
    * for `enet-coco.cfg (EfficientNetB0-Yolov3)` (14 MB): [enetb0-coco.conv.132](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uhh3D6RSn0ekgmsaTcl-ZW53WBaUDo6j/view?usp=sharing)
    

8. Start training by using the command line: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolov4.conv.137`
     
   To train on Linux use command: `./darknet detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolov4.conv.137` (just use `./darknet` instead of `darknet.exe`)
     
   * (file `yolo-obj_last.weights` will be saved to the `build\darknet\x64\backup\` for each 100 iterations)
   * (file `yolo-obj_xxxx.weights` will be saved to the `build\darknet\x64\backup\` for each 1000 iterations)
   * (to disable Loss-Window use `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolov4.conv.137 -dont_show`, if you train on computer without monitor like a cloud Amazon EC2)
   * (to see the mAP & Loss-chart during training on remote server without GUI, use command `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolov4.conv.137 -dont_show -mjpeg_port 8090 -map` then open URL `http://ip-address:8090` in Chrome/Firefox browser)

8.1. For training with mAP (mean average precisions) calculation for each 4 Epochs (set `valid=valid.txt` or `train.txt` in `obj.data` file) and run: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolov4.conv.137 -map`

9. After training is complete - get result `yolo-obj_final.weights` from path `build\darknet\x64\backup\`

 * After each 100 iterations you can stop and later start training from this point. For example, after 2000 iterations you can stop training, and later just start training using: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg backup\yolo-obj_2000.weights`

    (in the original repository https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet the weights-file is saved only once every 10 000 iterations `if(iterations > 1000)`)

 * Also you can get result earlier than all 45000 iterations.
 
 **Note:** If during training you see `nan` values for `avg` (loss) field - then training goes wrong, but if `nan` is in some other lines - then training goes well.
 
 **Note:** If you changed width= or height= in your cfg-file, then new width and height must be divisible by 32.
 
 **Note:** After training use such command for detection: `darknet.exe detector test data/obj.data yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_8000.weights`
 
  **Note:** if error `Out of memory` occurs then in `.cfg`-file you should increase `subdivisions=16`, 32 or 64: [link](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/0039fd26786ab5f71d5af725fc18b3f521e7acfd/cfg/yolov3.cfg#L4)
 
### How to train tiny-yolo (to detect your custom objects):

Do all the same steps as for the full yolo model as described above. With the exception of:
* Download file with the first 29-convolutional layers of yolov4-tiny: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v4_pre/yolov4-tiny.conv.29
 (Or get this file from yolov4-tiny.weights file by using command: `darknet.exe partial cfg/yolov4-tiny-custom.cfg yolov4-tiny.weights yolov4-tiny.conv.29 29`
* Make your custom model `yolov4-tiny-obj.cfg` based on `cfg/yolov4-tiny-custom.cfg` instead of `yolov4.cfg`
* Start training: `darknet.exe detector train data/obj.data yolov4-tiny-obj.cfg yolov4-tiny.conv.29`

For training Yolo based on other models ([DenseNet201-Yolo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/densenet201_yolo.cfg) or [ResNet50-Yolo](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/resnet50_yolo.cfg)), you can download and get pre-trained weights as showed in this file: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/blob/master/build/darknet/x64/partial.cmd
If you made you custom model that isn't based on other models, then you can train it without pre-trained weights, then will be used random initial weights.
